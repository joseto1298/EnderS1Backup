#pinned_commit:
#   A git commit hash to "pin" updates to.  When specified Moonraker will not
#   update the repo beyond the pinned commit.  If the repo is already beyond
#   the specified commit, or if the commit is not in the repo, futher updates
#   are disabled until the pinned_commit is changed.  It is recommended to
#   specify the complete hash, however abbreviated hashes with a minimum of
#   8 characters are accepted.  The "pinned_commit" overrides the update
#   behavior set by the "channel" option.  The default is no pinned commit.
